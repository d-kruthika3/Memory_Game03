This is a web development project built using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a competitive two-player card-matching game in which each player flips two cards at a time to find matching images.

If the two flipped cards match, the same player gets another turn and continues playing until they select a non-matching pair. When a mismatch occurs, the turn passes to the other player.

After all pairs have been matched, the scores are compared. The player with the higher score wins; if both players have the same score, the game ends in a tie.
